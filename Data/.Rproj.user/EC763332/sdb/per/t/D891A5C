Here, the equilibrium error follows a threshold autoregression that is mean-reverting outside a given range and has a unit root inside the range. We suggest a two-step approach for examining threshold cointegration. We find that standard time series methods developed for testing for cointegration in the linear case work reasonably well when threshold cointegration is present. We then consider a `sup-Wald' test of linearity that takes the double-threshold model as the alternative hypothesis.},\n author = {Nathan S. Balke and Thomas B.

We discuss likelihood ratio tests of cointegration rank and find the asymptotic distribution of the test statistics. We characterize the maximum likelihood estimator of the cointegrating relations and formulate tests of structural hypotheses about these relations. We show that the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator is mixed Gaussian. Once a certain eigenvalue problem is solved and the eigenvectors and eigenvalues calculated, one can conduct inference on the cointegrating rank using some nonstandard distributions, and test hypotheses about cointegrating relations using the χ <sup>2</sup> distribution.},\n author = {Søren Johansen},\n journal = {Econometrica},\n number = {6},\n pages = {1551-1580},\n publisher = {[Wiley, Econometric Society]},\n title = {Estimation and Hypothesis Testing of Cointegration Vectors in Gaussian Vector Autoregressive Models},\n volume = {59},\n year = {1991}\n}\n\n\n@article{granger1981some,\n  title={Some properties of time series data and their use in econometric model specification},\n  author={Granger, Clive WJ},\n  journal={Journal of econometrics},\n  volume={16},\n  number={1},\n  pages={121--130},\n  year={1981},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}\n@article{66e755df06db415c83234a6bbc768a39,\ntitle = \"Misspecifications in vector autoregressions and their effects on impulse responses and variance decompositions\",\nabstract = \"This paper investigates the consequences of model misspecifications in vector autoregressions (VARs).

Assuming the underlying economic system has an ARMA representation, we derive closed-form expressions for the inconsistency in VAR-parameter estimates caused by omitted variables, ignored moving average terms, incorrectly specified lag lengths, or incorrect orthogonalization of innovations. Using these results we derive the inconsistencies for implied impulse responses and variance decompositions.

We demonstrate that our test has good power and size properties over the Engle-Granger test when there are asymmetric departures from equilibrium. We consider an application--namely, whether there exists cointegration among interest rates for instruments with different maturities. This issue has been widely tested with mixed results. We argue that either cautious policy, or possibly opportunistic behavior on the part of the Federal Reserve implies that an equilibrium relationship between short- and long-term interest rates exists but that adjustments from disequilibrium are asymmetric in nature. Empirical tests using U.S. yields confirm the asymmetric nature of error correction among interest rates of different maturities.},\nurl = {http://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:bes:jnlbes:v:19:y:2001:i:2:p:166-76}\n}\n@article{doi:10.1080/07350015.1998.10524769,\nauthor = { Walter   Enders  and  C.

This hypothesis of Weiner is kept unchanged. However, we are more interested in the efficiency implications of a regionalized world oil market than its policy implications as discussed by Weiner. Specifically, if these prices deviate from each other, i.e., the market is fragmented, there will be arbitrage opportunities for crude oil traders which would render the market inefficient. In this paper, the regionalization hypothesis is investigated via cointegration tests using both spot and contract prices for fifteen crude oils. Three groups of similar quality crudes are formed based on API gravity and sulfur content. Tests of cross-group co-movement which provided evidence for significant quality differences between heavy and light crudes further supported our groupings. Then the co-movement of prices is tested within each group. The crash in 1986 is explicitly dealt with following methods described in Perron (1989). Results indicate that the world crude oil market is unified over the 1980-95 period.},\n author = {S.
